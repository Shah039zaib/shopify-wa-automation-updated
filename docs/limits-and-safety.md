# Limits & Safety

- Baileys is reverse-engineered: follow WhatsApp policy and avoid spam.
- Render free-tier: ephemeral disk; don't store sessions on disk if hosting bot there.
- Neon free-tier: limited storage & compute. Keep payloads small and avoid frequent session writes.
- OCR can be slow on server; prefer local OCR in bot for reliability.
